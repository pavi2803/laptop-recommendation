# Laptop Recommendation App

This Laptop Recommendation App is designed to help users find the best laptops based on their specific requirements such as company, type, RAM, and price. The app filters laptops from a dataset and displays the results, including a comparison of the highest and lowest prices, screen resolutions, memory, CPU, and other relevant details.
Tools Used:
Streamlit, Streamlit Library
Python Libraries- Pandas, Numpy


## Features

- **User Input:** Users can input their preferences for the laptop's company, type, RAM, and price in their preferred currency (Rupees, Dollars, or Euros).
- **Filtered Results:** The app processes the input and filters the laptops that match the user's criteria.
- **Price Comparison:** The app provides a comparison of the maximum and minimum prices of the laptops that meet the criteria, along with other details such as company, product name, screen resolution, memory, and CPU.
- **Responsive Output:** The results are displayed in a user-friendly HTML table, and if no laptops match the criteria, a "No Results" page is shown.

## Code Overview

- **`app.route("/input", methods=["GET", "POST"])`:** Handles the user input and processes the request based on the selected criteria.
- **`fetch_details_cpu(company, typename, ram, price)`:** Filters the dataset based on the user's input and returns the relevant data.
